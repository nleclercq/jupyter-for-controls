# **jupyter-for-controls**
Small projects, evaluations, POC, presentations, ... related to the Jupyter Ecosystem (and 'embeddable' technologies, e.g. bokeh) for controls. The main goal is to turn jupyter into a [Tango](https://www.tango-controls.org) feature-rich client plateform.

# **Installing jupyTango on Ubuntu Linux**
### **leveraging pytango, itango and bokeh features in the Jupyter notebook**

## About this notebook
This notebook belongs to a series of small projects which aim is to evaluate the [Jupyter](http://jupyter.org/) ecosystem for science experiments control. The main idea is to use the _Juypter notebook_ as a convergence platform in order to offer a fully featured environment to scientists. 

## About Tango 
[Tango](https://www.tango-controls.org) is a free open source device-oriented controls toolkit for controlling any kind of hardware or software and building SCADA (supervisory control and data acquisition) systems. Tango Controls is operating system independent and supports C++, Java and Python for all the components.

## About bokeh
Experiments control requires both static and dynamic (i.e live) data visualization. Since Jupyter doesn't provide any 'official' data visualization solution, we need to select one. Among the available solutions, [bokeh](http://bokeh.pydata.org/en/latest) presents the highest potential for our application.

## jupyTango installation
**the offcial jupyTango repo is now:  https://gitlab.com/tango-controls/jupyTango**

Enjoy!
